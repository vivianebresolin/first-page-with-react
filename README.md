# My First Page with React

As the title says, this is my first project with React.
It is an activity from the course 'Fullstack Developer - Starter Program' from [Growdev](https://www.growdev.com.br/).
It was given an example page and the goal was cloning it using React.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


This is the example given:
